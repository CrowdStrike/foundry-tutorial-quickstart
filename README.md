# Foundry Quickstart

> A basic "Hello World" app with Foundry.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To view this tutorial and import the app, you need access to the Falcon console.

This code is the result of doing the Falcon Foundry Quickstart. To see how it was created, please [visit our documentation](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/login/?unilogin=true&next=/documentation/page/p3e6b484/foundry-quickstart).

## Prerequisites

- Falcon Insight XDR or Falcon Prevent (one app)
- Falcon Next-Gen SIEM or Falcon Foundry (1+ apps depending on entitlement)
- The latest version of the Foundry CLI (instructions below)

### Install the Foundry CLI

You can install the Foundry CLI with Homebrew on Linux/macOS.

**Linux and macOS**:

Install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation). Then, add the Foundry CLI repository to the list of formulae that Homebrew uses and install the CLI:

```shell
brew tap crowdstrike/foundry-cli
brew install crowdstrike/foundry-cli/foundry
```

**Windows**:

Download the [latest Windows zip file](https://assets.foundry.crowdstrike.com/cli/latest/foundry_Windows_x86_64.zip), expand it, and add the installation directory to your PATH environment variable.

Verify it's installed correctly:

```shell
foundry version
```

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local system, or [download it as a zip file](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/foundry-quickstart/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CrowdStrike/foundry-quickstart
cd foundry-quickstart
```

Log in to Foundry:

```shell
foundry login
```

You don't need to select any specific permissions since this is just a hello world app.

- [ ] Run RTR Scripts
- [ ] Run, execute, and test Workflows
- [ ] Run, execute, and test API integrations
- [ ] Run, execute, and test LogScale queries
- [ ] (optional) Generate mock data to test your app

Deploy the app:

```shell
foundry apps deploy
```

> [!TIP]
> If you get an error that the name already exists, change the name to something unique to your CID in `manifest.yml`.

Once the deployment has finished, you can release the app:

```shell
foundry apps release
```

Next, go to **Foundry** > **App catalog**, find your app, and install it. Select the **Open App** button in the success dialog.

> [!TIP]
> If the app doesn't load, reload the page.
